**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps:

Convert the images to grayscale
Perform Gausian smoothing and apply Canny edge detection
Select region of interest and mask other areas of the image
Apply Hough Transform to detect lane lines
Superimpose the lane lines on the original image

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by:

Calculated slope and center of each line. Then based on the slope, sort it into right or left lane line
Calculate the average slope and the center of right and left lane
Then using the Y coordinates, based on Region of Interest, figure out the X cordinates using the avg slope and center point of lane lines [equation used: (y-y') = M (x-x')]

###2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

Potential shortcomings of my approach:

Slope conditions used for detecting right and left lanes do not work in case of a curve in the road




###3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

Possible improvements to my approach:

Make the image mask selection dynamic, so that it could work in different scenarios
Modify the slope conditions, so that they work with curve in the road
